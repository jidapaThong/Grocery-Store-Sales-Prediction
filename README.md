# Grocery Store Sales Prediction project

This study employed XGBoosting Regression and Random Forest algorithms to predict future sales for product families, comparing the performance of these ensemble models in sales prediction.

The forecasting sale will help the business grow and predict how much inventory to stock in each type of the product at the given respective stores. If the store has more groceries than the demand by the customers, this will lead to the problem of overstock, waste and perishable goods. On the other hand, if the grocery store has fewer products than what customers need, this will result in dissatisfied customers and reduced revenue.
